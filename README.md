# Overview

I built this program to learn more about the syntax and functionality of the Erlang programming language, and how to use it properly.

I wrote a program in Erlang lets the user play three different minigames, a user number guessing game, a rock, paper,scissors game, and a computer number guessing game.

My purpose for writing this software was to introduce myself to the Erlang language, and functional programming in general.

# Development Environment

I used the Visual Studio Code IDE.

I created this program using the Erlang language. I also used the uniform function by importing the rand module.
